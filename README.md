# My Awesome Package

An NPM (Node Package Manager) package is a module or library of code that can be shared and reused in other projects. NPM allows you to publish your own packages to the public, or just for personal use, and makes code sharing easier.

In this tutorial, we will create a simple utility package with three functions:

1.Addition of two numbers
2.Subtraction of two numbers
3.Palindrome checker for strings
## Installation

```bash
npm install @adarshpv/package-creation
